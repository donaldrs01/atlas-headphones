I created a desktop, tablet and mobile version of the Headphones website. 

Using media query, the appropriate stylesheet should render based on the following screen sizes: <br>
    Mobile: Width less than 480px <br>
    Tablet: Width between 481 - 999px <br>
    Desktop: Width greater than 1000px <br>
